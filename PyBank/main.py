"""
Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
